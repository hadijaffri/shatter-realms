# Stripe Setup Instructions for Vercel

## Environment Variables Required

To enable coin purchases, you need to add these environment variables to your Vercel project:

### 1. Go to your Vercel dashboard

- Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Select your project (i-like-mangos)
- Go to Settings → Environment Variables

### 2. Add these variables:

**STRIPE_SECRET_KEY**

```
Get this from your local .env file or Stripe dashboard (starts with sk_test_)
```

**STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY**

```
Get this from your Stripe dashboard (starts with pk_test_)
```

**Note**: Your actual keys are stored in your local `.env` file which is not committed to Git for security reasons.

### 3. Select environments

- Check: Production
- Check: Preview
- Check: Development

### 4. Save and redeploy

After adding the variables, trigger a new deployment or wait for the next push to deploy.
